# Hotwire Dev Tools

## Test on Firefox
The easiest way is to make us of the [web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) tool:
```bash
npm install --global web-ext
web-ext run
```
That will open a new Firefox window with the extension installed and hot reloading enabled.
